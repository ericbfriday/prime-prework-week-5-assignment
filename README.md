## Objects and Prototypes
Here we'll take a look at using a prototype class and explore creating a new object from this class. Also, we'll delve into the basics of Object Oriented Programming by using properties and methods of an object derived from a prototype.

### Topics Covered
* Creating a new object from a prototype class
* Accessing data within an object
* Adding a method to an object
* Calling an object's method

You can refer to the Codecademy lesson JavaScript 8 (Objects II) for reference if needed.

### Step 1
* create a new animal named "somethingFun" with a first name of "Something" a last name of "Fun" and a type of "Cat"

### Step 2
* console log out somethingFun's first and last name

### Step 3 (Hard Mode)
* add a method to somethingFun named "meow()" that console logs "meow" when called. ex: somethingFun.meow()
* add another method to somethingFun named that receives a boolean argument "happy"
* within this method, check if the "happy" is true
 * if so, console log "purrrrrr"
 * if not, console log "crabby face"

### Step 4 (Pro Mode)
Check out "bringItTogether.js" which (ahem) brings together weeks 4 and 5. There are many tasks that take multiple steps to complete in here including the following:

* the concepts used in Normal and Hard Mode
* converting arrays to objects
* using constructors

You will find the problem description in a separate markdown file: [bringItTogether.md](bringItTogether.md). Good luck!

### Files Provided
* index.html - Sources the JavaScript file (`prototypes.js`). There isn't much happening here and you are not required to make changes to this file.
* prototypes.js - This is where you will add your code for Normal and Hard Modes. We have provided some scaffolding code and comments to help you get started.
* bringItTogether.js - This is where you will add your code if attempting Pro Mode. We have provided some scaffolding code and comments to help you get started. You will need to source this into your HTML file.
